# Jasper
Jasper makes plots

Install using the `devtools` package (which you may need to install first using `install.packages("devtools")` in the usual way).
Then run
```
require(devtools)
install_github("arnhew99/Jasper")
```

This should download and install Jasper into your usual R packages directory. Following this you can run
```
require(Jasper)
```
as usual when you want to use it (i.e. there is no further need for the `devtools` package)
